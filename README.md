# omero2pandas

A convenience package to download data from OMERO.tables into Pandas dataframes.

# Installation

omero2pandas can be installed with pip on Python 3.6+:
```
pip install omero2pandas
```
omero2pandas also supports authentication using tokens generated by `omero-user-token`. 
Compatible versions can be installed as follows:
```
pip install omero2pandas[token]
```
See the [omero-user-token documentation](https://github.com/glencoesoftware/omero-user-token) for more information.


# Usage

```python
import omero2pandas
df = omero2pandas.read_table(file_id=402)
df.head()
```

Tables can be referenced based on their OriginalFile's ID or their Annotation's ID. 
These can be easily obtained by hovering over the relevant table in OMERO.web, which shows a tooltip with these IDs.

To avoid loading data directly into a dataframe, you can also download directly into a CSV:

```python
import omero2pandas
omero2pandas.download_table("/path/to/output.csv", file_id=2, chunk_size=1000)
```

`chunk_size` can be specified when both reading and downloading tables. It determines 
how many rows are loaded from the server in a single operation.

### Supplying credentials

Multiple modes of connecting to OMERO are supported. If you're already familiar with omero-py, you can supply a premade client:

```python
import omero
import omero2pandas
my_client = omero.client(host="myserver", port=4064)
df = omero2pandas.read_table(file_id=402, omero_connector=my_client)
df.head()
```

Alternatively, your connection and login details can be provided via arguments:

```python
import omero2pandas
df = omero2pandas.read_table(file_id=402, server="omero.mysite.com", port=4064,
                             username="myuser", password="mypass")
df.head()
```

If you have `omero_user_token` installed, an existing token will be automatically detected and used to connect:

```python
import omero2pandas
df = omero2pandas.read_table(file_id=402)
df.head()
```

You can also generate the connection object separately using the built-in wrapper:
```python
import omero2pandas
connector = omero2pandas.connect_to_omero(server="myserver", port=4064)
# User will be prompted for any missing connection info. 

df = omero2pandas.read_table(file_id=402, omero_connector=connector)
df.head()
```

When prompting for missing connection information, the package automatically detects whether 
omero2pandas is running in a Jupyter environment. If so, you'll get a login widget to complete details.
Otherwise a CLI interface will be provided.

This behaviour can be disabled by supplying `interactive=False` to the connect call.

## Reading data

Several utility methods are provided for working with OMERO.tables. These all support the full range of connection modes.

Fetch the names of the columns in a table:
```python
import omero2pandas
columns = omero2pandas.get_table_columns(annotation_id=142)
# Returns a list of column names
```

Fetch the dimensions of a table:
```python
import omero2pandas
num_rows, num_cols = omero2pandas.get_table_size(annotation_id=12)
# Returns a tuple containing row and column count.
```


You can read out specific rows and/or columns
```python
import omero2pandas
my_dataframe = omero2pandas.read_table(file_id=10, 
                                       column_names=['object', 'intensity'],
                                       rows=range(0, 100, 10))
my_dataframe.head()
# Returns object and intensity columns for every 10th row in the table
```

Returned dataframes also come with a pandas index column, representing the original row numbers from the OMERO.table.

## Writing data

Pandas dataframes can also be written back as new OMERO.tables.
N.b. It is currently not possible to modify a table on the server.

Connection handling works just as it does with downloading, you can 
provide credentials, a token or a connection object.

To upload data, the user needs to specify which OMERO object(s) the table
will be associated with. This can be achieved with the `parent_id` and 
`parent_type` arguments. Supported objects are Dataset, 
Well, Plate, Project, Screen and Image.

```python
import pandas
import omero2pandas
my_data = pandas.read_csv("/path/to/my_data.csv")
ann_id = omero2pandas.upload_table(my_data, "Name for table", 
                                   parent_id=142, parent_type="Image")
# Returns the annotation ID of the uploaded FileAnnotation object
```

Once uploaded, the table will be accessible on OMERO.web under the file 
annotations panel of the parent object. Using unique table names is advised.

### OMERO ID columns

OMERO.tables support some special column types which associate tabular data 
with objects on the server. These are defined as integer columns with the 
following names: `project`, `dataset`, `image`, `screen`, `plate`, `well` and 
`roi`. These names are case-insensitive. For example, a row with an `Image` 
column with the value `1033` will be associated with Image 1033.

To display this in omero-web the table itself should be linked to either the 
object itself or a parent container. i.e. If you have an `image` column 
referencing several images in a dataset, attach the table itself to the parent 
dataset and the relevant row data will be visible when viewing the 
individual images in omero-web.

### Linking to multiple objects

To link to multiple objects, you can supply a list of `(<type>, <id>)`
tuples to the `links` parameter. The resulting table's FileAnnotation 
will be linked to all objects in the `links` parameter (plus 
`parent_type`:`parent_id` if provided).


```python
import omero2pandas
ann_id = omero2pandas.upload_table(
    "/path/to/my.csv", "My table", 
    links=[("Image", 101), ("Dataset", 2), ("Roi", 1923)])
# Uploads with Annotation links to Image 101, Dataset 2 and ROI 1923 
```

Links allow OMERO.web to display the resulting table as 
an annotation associated with those objects.


### Large Tables
The first argument to `upload_table` can be a pandas dataframe or a path to a 
.csv file containing the table data. In the latter case the table will be read 
in chunks corresponding to the `chunk_size` argument. This will allow you to 
upload tables which are too large to load into system memory.

```python
import omero2pandas
ann_id = omero2pandas.upload_table("/path/to/my.csv", "My table", 
                                   142, chunk_size=100)
# Reads and uploads the file to Image 142, loading 100 lines at a time 
```

The `chunk_size` argument sets how many rows to send with each call to the server. 
If not specified, omero2pandas will attempt to automatically optimise chunk 
size to send ~2 million table cells per call (up to a max of 50,000 
rows per message for narrow tables).




# Advanced Usage

This package also contains utility functions for managing an OMERO connection.

`omero2pandas.connect_to_omero()` takes many of the arguments from the other functions and returns an `OMEROConnection` object.

The `OMEROConnection` handles your OMERO login and session, cleaning everything up automatically on exit. This has some accessory methods to access useful API calls:

```python
import omero2pandas
connector = omero2pandas.OMEROConnection()
connector.connect()
client = connector.get_client()
blitz = connector.get_gateway()
```
When a client is active within the `OMEROConnection` object, calls to this wrapper class will also be forwarded directly to the client object.

OMEROConnection objects can also be used as a context manager:
```python
import omero2pandas
with omero2pandas.OMEROConnection(server='my.server', port=4064, 
                                  username='test.user',) as connector:
    blitz = connector.get_gateway()
    image = blitz.getObject('Image', id=100)
    # Continue using the standard OMERO API.
```

The context manager will handle session creation and cleanup automatically.

### Connection Management

omero2pandas keeps track of any active connector objects and shuts them down 
safely when Python exits. Deleting all references to a connector will also 
handle closing the connection to OMERO gracefully. You can also call 
`connector.shutdown()` to close a connection manually.

By default omero2pandas also keeps active connections alive by pinging the 
server once per minute (otherwise the session may timeout and require 
reconnecting). This can be disabled as follows 

```python
omero2pandas.connect_to_omero(keep_alive=False)
```

### Querying tables

You can also supply [PyTables condition syntax](https://www.pytables.org/usersguide/condition_syntax.html) to the `read_table` and `download_table` functions.
Returned tables will only include rows which pass this filter.

**Basic syntax**

Select rows representing objects with area greater than 20:
```python
omero2pandas.read_table(file_id=10, query='(area>20)')
```

**Multiple conditions**

Select rows representing objects with an even ID number lower than 50:
```python
omero2pandas.read_table(file_id=10, query='(id%2==0) & (id<50)')
```

**Complex conditions** 

Select rows representing objects which originated from an ROI named 'Nucleus':
```python
omero2pandas.read_table(file_id=10, query='x!="Nucleus"', variables={'x': omero.rtypes.rstring('Roi Name')})
```

N.b. Column names containing spaces aren't supported by the native syntax, but can be supplied as variables which are provided by the `variables` parameter.

The variables map needs to be a dictionary mapping string variables to [OMERO rtypes](https://omero.readthedocs.io/en/v5.6.9/developers/GettingStarted/AdvancedClientDevelopment.html#rtypes) objects rather than raw Python objects. 
These should match the relevant column type. Mapped variables are substituted into the query during processing.

A `variables` map usually isn't needed for simple queries. The basic condition string should automatically get converted to a meaningful type, but when this fails 
replacing tricky elements with a variable may help.

### Remote registration

For **OMERO Plus** installations which support TileDB as the OMERO.tables backend 
it is possible to register tables in-place in a similar manner to in-place image 
imports (otherwise table data is stored in the ManagedRepository).

This is a two-step process:
1) Convert the dataframe into a TileDB file
2) Register the remote converted table with OMERO

If you don't know what table backend your OMERO Plus server is using, you 
probably don't have this feature available. If you have access to the server 
machine you can check by running `omero config get omero.tables.module`, 
if the response is `omero_plus.run_tables_pytables_or_tiledb` then tiledb is 
available.

For this mode to be available extra dependencies must also be installed as follows

```bash
pip install omero2pandas[remote]
```

To activate this mode use `omero2pandas.upload_table` with arguments as 
follows:

```python
import omero2pandas
db_path = omero2pandas.upload_table("/path/to/my_data.csv", "Name for table", 
                                    local_path="/path/to/mytable.tiledb")
# Returns the path to the created tiledb file
```

Similar to regular table uploads, the input can be a dataframe in memory or a 
csv file on disk. The input will be copied into a new TileDB database and 
registered to OMERO in-place.

To perform this kind of registration you need to provide the `local_path` argument 
to the standard `omero2pandas.upload_table` function (alongside required params for 
a "normal" upload e.g. server connection details). The local path is the file path 
where the tiledb file will be written to and registered to OMERO from. 
If you provide a directory instead the tiledb file will be named based on the `table_name` argument.

Naturally, the OMERO server will need to be able to access the resulting tiledb file 
in order to be registered. If the `local_path` is also visible from the server machine
(e.g. you're running the upload on the server itself) then that's sufficient. Otherwise 
a `remote_path` argument is also available to tell the server where it should 
find the table. This is typically needed if the tiledb file ends up mounted at a 
different location between the local machine and the OMERO server.

For example, if registering from a Windows machine with a network drive to an OMERO server on Linux:
```python
omero2pandas.upload_table(
    df, "My Custom Table",
    local_path="J:\\data\\tables\\my_omero_table.tiledb",
    remote_path="/network_data/tables/my_omero_table.tiledb"
)
```

Effectively, `local_path` is where the current machine should write the data to, `remote_path` 
is where that file will be from the OMERO server's point of view. No remote path 
implies that both machines will see the file at the local path.

Note that when a table is registered remotely it is not part of the Managed Repository 
used to store OMERO data. This means that it becomes the user's responsibility to 
update the table object on the OMERO server if the file is moved/deleted.

#### How it works

Remote registration is a two-step process: conversion to TileDB format followed 
by registration using a HTTP API. 

The TileDB conversion is handled automatically by omero2pandas. This largely involves 
creating a TileDB database from your dataframe and adding a few details to 
the converted table array metadata. Most native pandas column types are supported.

The actual registration involves telling the server that we'd like to register a 
remote table and providing it with the TileDB location. There is then a 
validation process to ensure that the table seen by the server is the same one that 
the user has requested the API to register. This is achieved by writing a "SecretToken" 
key to the tiledb array metadata. The tiledb file seen by the server must have a key 
matching the one provided in the registration call managed by omero2pandas.

While it is possible to manually create and register tables without a `SecretToken`, 
this is strongly discouraged as other users could potentially register and access 
the same table without permission. With that in mind the implementation within 
omero2pandas could be considered as an example of "best practice" for handling 
remote table registration.

If the registration succeeds the tables API will create all the necessary OMERO 
objects and return a FileAnnotation ID just as if we'd uploaded the table normally.

#### Converting to TileDB format without registration

While the processes of tiledb conversion and remote registration are intended to 
be used together, it is possible to only convert a table to an OMERO Plus-compatible
TileDB file. This can be achieved as follows:

```python
import pandas as pd
from omero2pandas.remote import create_tiledb
df = pd.read_csv("/path/to/table.csv")
secret_token = create_tiledb(df, "/path/to/output.tiledb")
```

This will convert an input dataframe of csv file path into a TileDB file with 
appropriate metadata for remote registration.

For convenience the creation function will return the SecretToken needed to perform 
remote registration securely. That token could also be retrieved from the TileDB 
file metadata if necessary.
